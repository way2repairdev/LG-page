# ZOOM JUMPING FIX - TEST PROCEDURE

## What We Fixed
We fixed a critical bug in the HandleZoom function where boundary calculations were using the OLD pageHeightSum instead of calculating it with the NEW zoom level. This caused incorrect scroll offset clamping, especially affecting the last pages.

## Test Steps

### 1. Load a Multi-Page PDF
- Load a PDF with at least 10+ pages
- Navigate to the last few pages (last 3-5 pages)

### 2. Test Zoom on Last Pages
- Position your cursor anywhere on the last page
- Use mouse wheel to zoom in/out
- **BEFORE FIX**: Would jump to earlier pages
- **AFTER FIX**: Should stay on the same page and zoom smoothly

### 3. Check Debug Files
After testing, check these files for debugging information:
- `build/zoom_debug.txt` - Detailed zoom state before/after each operation
- `build/pdf_embedder_debug.txt` - General PDF viewer debugging

### 4. Compare with Standalone Viewer
- Test the same PDF in your standalone viewer
- The embedded viewer should now behave identically

## What to Look For in Debug Files

### Success Indicators in zoom_debug.txt:
```
=== ZOOM DEBUG - BEFORE HandleZoom ===
Visible pages: 8 to 10
NEAR LAST PAGE: YES
... (after HandleZoom) ...
New visible pages: 8 to 10  <-- Should NOT jump to earlier pages
ZOOM JUMP DETECTED: NO      <-- Should be NO
```

### Problem Indicators (if fix didn't work):
```
NEAR LAST PAGE: YES
... (after HandleZoom) ...
New visible pages: 3 to 5   <-- BAD: Jumped to earlier pages
!!! PROBLEMATIC JUMP: Was on last pages, now on earlier pages !!!
```

## Additional Testing

### Test 1: Different Cursor Positions
- Try zooming with cursor at:
  - Top of last page
  - Middle of last page  
  - Bottom of last page
- All should work without jumping

### Test 2: Different Zoom Levels
- Start from 100% zoom on last page
- Zoom in to 200%, 300%, 400%
- Zoom back out to 100%
- Should stay on last page throughout

### Test 3: Different PDF Types
- Test with PDFs that have:
  - Different page sizes
  - Many pages (20+)
  - Mixed portrait/landscape pages

## If the Issue Persists

If you still see jumping behavior, check the debug files for:
1. **Scroll offset calculations** - Look for sudden changes in scrollOffset
2. **Boundary constraint issues** - Look for maxVerticalOffset values
3. **Coordinate system problems** - Look for cursor position vs window size

Let me know the results and I can provide additional fixes if needed!
