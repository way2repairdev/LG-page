# Visible Content Rendering Fixes

## Problem Description
The PDF viewer was experiencing blank/invisible content during scrolling, panning, and zooming operations. Pages would appear blank even when they were supposed to be visible in the viewport.

## Root Cause Analysis
The core issue was that the `renderPDF()` function only rendered pages that **already had textures** (`m_pageTextures[i] != 0`), but it did not generate textures for visible pages that were missing them. This caused blank pages when:

1. You scroll quickly and texture cleanup removes textures
2. You zoom and the visible texture update logic doesn't generate all needed textures  
3. You pan and progressive rendering doesn't complete in time
4. Navigation events (scroll bar, wheel, pan) don't properly trigger texture regeneration

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed renderPDF() - Generate Missing Textures On-Demand
**Location:** `src/ui/pdfviewerwidget.cpp` - `renderPDF()` function

**Before:** Only rendered pages that already had textures
```cpp
if (i >= 0 && i < static_cast<int>(m_pageTextures.size()) && m_pageTextures[i] != 0) {
    // Only render if texture exists
}
```

**After:** Generate textures immediately for visible pages if missing
```cpp
// CRITICAL FIX: Generate texture immediately if missing
if (i >= static_cast<int>(m_pageTextures.size()) || m_pageTextures[i] == 0) {
    // Generate texture immediately for visible page
    // Render texture with proper zoom and size constraints
    // Show placeholder if generation fails
}
```

### 2. Fixed Scroll Bar Event Handler
**Location:** `src/ui/pdfviewerwidget.cpp` - `onVerticalScrollBarChanged()`

**Added:** Immediate texture updates for scroll bar navigation
```cpp
// CRITICAL: Trigger texture updates immediately for scroll bar navigation
if (context() && context()->isValid()) {
    makeCurrent();
    updateVisibleTextures();
    doneCurrent();
}
```

### 3. Fixed Wheel Scroll Event Handler  
**Location:** `src/ui/pdfviewerwidget.cpp` - `wheelEvent()` (Ctrl+wheel scrolling)

**Added:** Texture updates for wheel-based scrolling
```cpp
// CRITICAL: Trigger texture updates for wheel scrolling to ensure visible content
if (context() && context()->isValid()) {
    makeCurrent();
    updateVisibleTextures();
    doneCurrent();
}
```

### 4. Fixed Panning Event Handler
**Location:** `src/ui/pdfviewerwidget.cpp` - `handlePanning()`

**Added:** Texture updates for panning operations
```cpp
// CRITICAL: Trigger texture updates for panning to ensure visible content
if (context() && context()->isValid()) {
    makeCurrent();
    updateVisibleTextures();
    doneCurrent();
}
```

### 5. Improved updateVisibleTextures() Function
**Location:** `src/ui/pdfviewerwidget.cpp` - `updateVisibleTextures()`

**Enhanced:** More aggressive texture generation for visible pages
- Fixed visible page calculation logic (use -1 initialization instead of 0)
- Immediately generate missing textures for all visible pages
- Update `m_lastRenderedZoom` to track when textures need regeneration
- More robust handling of zoom changes

### 6. Improved Texture Cleanup Logic
**Location:** `src/ui/pdfviewerwidget.cpp` - `cleanupUnusedTextures()`

**Enhanced:** More conservative texture cleanup to prevent thrashing
- Larger buffer zones around visible content
- Only clean textures that are far from visible area
- Better safety checks to avoid deleting visible page textures

## Key Behavioral Changes

### Before the Fix:
- Pages would go blank during scrolling, panning, or zooming
- Scroll bar navigation would show empty content
- Fast navigation would result in missing textures
- Content would only appear after stopping navigation for a while

### After the Fix:
- **Immediate texture generation:** Visible pages always have textures generated on-demand during rendering
- **Aggressive texture updates:** All navigation operations (scroll bar, wheel, pan, zoom) trigger immediate texture updates
- **Conservative cleanup:** Texture cleanup is more careful to avoid deleting textures for visible/soon-to-be-visible pages
- **Responsive rendering:** Content appears immediately during all navigation operations

## Performance Considerations

The fixes prioritize **content visibility** over raw performance:

1. **On-demand generation** in `renderPDF()` ensures visible content is never blank
2. **Immediate texture updates** in navigation handlers ensure responsive feedback
3. **Conservative cleanup** prevents texture thrashing at the cost of higher memory usage
4. **High zoom optimizations** still use progressive rendering for smooth experience

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the fixes work correctly:

1. **Scroll Bar Test:** Drag the scroll bar up/down rapidly - content should always be visible
2. **Wheel Scroll Test:** Use Ctrl+wheel to scroll quickly - no blank pages should appear
3. **Pan Test:** Right-click drag to pan around - content should remain visible during panning
4. **Zoom Test:** Mouse wheel zoom in/out - content should appear immediately at new zoom levels
5. **Combined Test:** Rapidly switch between scrolling, panning, and zooming - content should never go blank

## Files Modified

1. `src/ui/pdfviewerwidget.cpp`
   - `renderPDF()` - Added on-demand texture generation
   - `onVerticalScrollBarChanged()` - Added texture updates
   - `wheelEvent()` - Added texture updates for scrolling
   - `handlePanning()` - Added texture updates
   - `updateVisibleTextures()` - Improved visible page logic and immediate generation
   - `cleanupUnusedTextures()` - More conservative cleanup

The fixes ensure that visible viewport content is **always rendered** and **never blank** during any navigation operation.
