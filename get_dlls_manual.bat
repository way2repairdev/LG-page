echo          Getting Critical DLL Files
echo ===============================================
echo.
echo This will download the essential DLL files needed for your application.
echo.

:: For now, let's tell the user how to get the DLLs manually
echo IMPORTANT: You need these DLL files for the application to run:
echo.
echo 1. GLEW DLL (glew32.dll)
echo    Download from: https://github.com/nigels-com/glew/releases/latest
echo    Extract and copy glew32.dll to:
echo    %~dp0src\pdf\third_party\extern\glew\bin\Release\x64\
echo.
echo 2. PDFium DLL (pdfium.dll) - OPTIONAL
echo    Download from: https://github.com/bblanchon/pdfium-binaries/releases/latest
echo    Extract and copy pdfium.dll to:
echo    %~dp0src\pdf\third_party\extern\pdfium\bin\
echo.
echo    OR use Qt's built-in PDF module (already configured in CMakeLists.txt)
echo.
echo 3. After placing the DLLs, run:
echo    check_deps.bat
echo    build.bat
echo.
echo ===============================================
echo           Quick Setup Option
echo ===============================================
echo.
echo If you want to skip the custom PDF viewer and use Qt's built-in PDF module:
echo 1. Just run build.bat (the CMakeLists.txt will handle missing PDFium)
echo 2. The application will use Qt's PDF module instead
echo.
echo This is actually the RECOMMENDED approach for easier maintenance!
echo.
