This is a sample text file for testing the Way2Repair file browser.

The file browser now supports:
- Local file loading from the test_documents folder
- Tab-based interface for viewing multiple files
- Automatic file type detection
- Proper syntax highlighting for different file types

Features:
✓ Tree view navigation
✓ Multiple file tabs
✓ File content display
✓ Tab closing functionality
✓ Refresh capability

File Types Supported:
- Text files (.txt)
- Source code files (.cpp, .h, .js, .py, etc.)
- Configuration files (.json, .xml, .ini)
- Log files (.log)
- And many more!

Instructions:
1. Click on files in the tree view to open them
2. Files will open in separate tabs
3. Use the X button to close tabs
4. Use the refresh button to reload the file tree

This demonstrates the local file loading functionality replacing the previous server-based approach.
