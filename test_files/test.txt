Test PDF content - this is a placeholder for testing the PDF viewer functionality.
The application should now have:
1. A working file browser that shows local files
2. A tab system that can open different file types
3. Basic PDF viewer structure (though PDF rendering is temporarily disabled)

The build is now successful and the application runs without crashing.
